# OthelloAI
Purpose: A barebones working CLI version of Othello for implementing Neural Networks or Deep Learning etc.

Implemented:
  - Basic 2 Player Game
  - Being able to replay game 
  - Random Agent
  - Player vs Player
  - Player vs Random Agent
  - AI for player vs computer
  - Neural Network
  - AI vs AI can be implemented super easy, just make a new section in "select players"  and change both of the player types to Smart Othello.


  # To Run

  1.) pip install -r requirements.txt
  2.) Look at main.py. This is where you can simulate a lot of games, run neural networks, training, and more. 
  3.) If you are satisfied, simply run main.py! Enjoy the game!

  # Recorded runs:
  Here is some sample Data so far
  
  Iteration 1: Random Vs Random
  Completed Games: 10,000
  Black Won: 47%
  White Won: 47%
  Draw: 4%

  Trains for 15,000 Iterations

  Sample Agent Game:

  After Playing 1000 here are the results:
  The Agent won: 54%
  The Agent lost: 42%
  Draws: 3%
